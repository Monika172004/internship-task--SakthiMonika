ChatGPT Usage Summary 

While working on Task 1 (Price Gap Pair Finder), I used ChatGPT mainly as a learning and problem-solving partner.  
I wanted to understand the logic behind the algorithm instead of just writing code that works.  
The conversation helped me reason through different approaches and refine my final implementation.



Prompt 1:
"Help me solve this" (after uploading the task document)

Response:
ChatGPT walked me through the problem and helped me think about how to efficiently find two indices (i, j) such that abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) == k.  
It explained how using a hash map can reduce the time complexity to O(n), and how to make sure the result remains the lexicographically smallest pair.



Prompt 2:
"How can I make sure my code handles duplicates and negative numbers correctly?"

Response:
ChatGPT explained how to store only the first occurrence of each number to handle duplicates correctly and how to make sure negative values work seamlessly with absolute differences.  
This helped me make the code more reliable and general.



Prompt 3:
"How do I make the code more readable without overcomplicating it?"

Response:
ChatGPT suggested using type hints, clean variable names, and minimal nested conditions.  
That feedback helped me balance simplicity and clarity in the final version.



Prompt 4:
"What are the edge cases I should test before submitting?"

Response:
ChatGPT recommended testing with zeros, duplicate values, all identical numbers, and cases where no valid pair exists.  
I used those cases to verify that my program gives the correct output in every situation.



Prompt 5:
"Can you explain why a hash map is better here than sorting and searching?"

Response:
ChatGPT compared both methods and explained that hashing gives constant-time lookups, making it faster and more scalable for large input lists.  
That discussion helped me understand not just how the algorithm works but why it’s efficient.
